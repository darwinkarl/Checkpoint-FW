Important Notes

For backup instructions, refer to sk108902 - Best Practices - Backup on Gaia OS.

Reboot and do the procedure in Maintenance Mode only.
Refer to sk109047 - How to enter the Boot menu on Gaia OS.

It takes some minutes to change a partition size.

To enter maintenance mode in the cloud, refer to sk170732 - Maintenance mode for Azure, AWS and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) 

There is no console in Amazon Web Services (AWS). As a result, there is no access to Maintenance Mode.

To increase the timeout value to boot into Maintenance Mode, refer to sk128112 - How to increase the timeout value to boot into maintenance mode.

It is not necessary to allocate disk space to the reserved backup/upgrade partition when you increase the "log" partition.
